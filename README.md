# accessibility-refactor
## Description
The Horiseon Marketing Agencyâ€™s website code was refactored for this assignment to be more web accessible and optimized for search engines. Given the importance of website accessibility and search engine optimization for businesses, this was a great opportunity to modify the code to meet industry standards and stay in line with competitive markets.  

Enhancing a websites accessibility is important because it gives the search engine robots a clear, descriptive, weighted "map" of the website to understand, crawl and index, while giving users search results that are more relevant and in line with what they're looking for.  Leading to overall higher page ranking and placement of the website, higher chance of possible income from advertising as well as a higher chance of success for the the product and services offered. 

Web accessibility also allows those with disabilities to use assistive technologies available today to have access to businesses and content online.  This is important because while it can protect businesses from possible "lack of access" lawsuits, it opens the doors to a target audience that hasn't traditionally been marketed to online thus providing an opportunity for growth. 

It was very interesting to learn that the code can be fully altered, modified and refactored to be more easily read and understood while the aesthetics of the website remain unchanged.
